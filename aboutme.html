    <h1> Hello,</h1>
    <p> I am Samuel Chaves and this is one of my projects, I have been studying computer programming for the past 3
        months and I have always loved the gym.
        So I decided to combine both on some sort of Online Auto 3000 Backflip Smart Tesla Personal Trainer. It is
        definitely a not fully finished project and it has
        space for fo much more, but at least I can give you guys an idea of my idea.

        I hope you enjoy all the little things I decided to implement to make this website more fluid and dynamic.

        Cheers!
    </p>
