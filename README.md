AS of today, unfortunately all the responsabilities and roles of this project will be direct to me ( Samuel Chaves ) Since none of my groupmates decided to reach out.

July 28 - Update So we have talked more about the initial idea of the group project and have agreed with some future changes, where it could make coding a little bit easier for us, since we are all beginners here.

Today we are changing the initial look of the page, adding basic secondary pages and linking them to the main page. Will probably play with CSS more to make sure the website is more aesthetic. But as the beginning idea it would be something simple but still make it look "tight".

Implementation of a simple user form which will be later on added mode detail and developed into a "User STATS"

We are also going to organize the github repository which will be Salomon part on todays submission.

No problems were really found, I had a little confusion to add someone to my project but I got it figured it out. 

Thank you, Samuel.
